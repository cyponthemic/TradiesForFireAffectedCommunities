# tradiesforfireaffectedcommunities

> The devastating fires we’ve seen for the last 5 months are unprecedented, and unparalleled. However, community spirit, selflessness and the willingness to go out of your way to help complete strangers is by far, the shining light that comes out of the ashes. As tradies we are forever helping mates, and this is no different. So if you’d like to get your hands dirty and help out the community, please register your input above. And if you’re a bushfire victim looking for help, please do the same and we will put you in contact with the right people. Keep up the great work!
